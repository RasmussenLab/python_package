# Example Python package

## How to use

Can be used as GitHub template repository,
see [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

You will need to find and replace occurences of `mockup` with the name of your package. This still might
need further testing:

```bash
# currently these are (v24.03)

pyproject.toml:
  5  description = "A small example package"
  6: name = "rasmussenlab-mockup"
  7  # This means: Load the version from the package itself.
